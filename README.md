This project will showcase Javascript working with the HTML and CSS by both creating HTML elements using user input and changing these elements' CSS properties.

The project is a simple pixel art tool where you can draw by hovering over pixels. Each pixel hovered over will change to a random colour, and gain opacity. Ten passes over one pixel makes it completely opaque.
